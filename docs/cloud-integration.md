## Github Configuration

### Generating a GitHub Personal Access Token

To enable your Flutter CLI tool to upload and delete releases on GitHub, you'll need to generate a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with the appropriate permissions. Follow the steps below to create and configure your token.

#### Steps to Generate a GitHub Token

1. **Open the GitHub Token Generation Page**:

   - [Generate GitHub Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).

2. **Set the Token Name**:

   - In the **Note** field, enter a descriptive name for your token, such as `Flutter Release X Token`.

3. **Select Scopes**:

   - Under **Select scopes**, check the following permissions:
     - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
       - This includes access to public and private repositories, which is required for uploading and deleting releases.

4. **Generate the Token**:

   - Click the **Generate token** button at the bottom of the page.
   - Copy the token immediately, as you wonâ€™t be able to see it again.

5. **Set Up Your Project**:

   ```yaml
   github:
     enabled: true
     token: YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
   ```

## Google Drive Configuration

To upload files to Google Drive, follow these steps to set up your credentials:

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**:

   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing one.

2. **Enable the Drive API**:

   - In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**.
   - Search for "Google Drive API" and enable it.

3. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**:

   - Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
   - Click on **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth Client ID**.
   - Configure the consent screen if prompted.
   - Set the application type to **Desktop App**.
   - Note down the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

4. **Set Up Your Project**:

   ```yaml
   google_drive:
     enabled: true
     client_id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
     client_secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
   ```

   By following these steps, your application will be able to authenticate with Google Drive using the client ID and secret to upload files.
