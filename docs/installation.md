Flutter Release X can be installed globally using `dart pub`:

```bash
dart pub global activate flutter_release_x
```

Or, add it as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml:

```bash
dart pub add flutter_release_x
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit dart pub get):

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_release_x: <LATEST_VERSION>
```

Alternatively, your editor might support dart pub get or flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

:::tip ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip
For maximum flexibility, install **Flutter Release X** globally! This allows you to use it across **any project**, whether it's **Flutter, React, or other non-Flutter projects**.

However, note that **only the Advanced Pipeline feature** is supported for non-Flutter projects.

```bash
dart pub global activate flutter_release_x
```

By installing it globally, you can run `frx` commands from anywhere on your system!
